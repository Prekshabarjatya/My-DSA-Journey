1. What was the core concept of Sliding window? It's all about working on what matters. Instead of recalculating everything for each window, you just slide through the array, updating the sum by adding the new piece and removing the old piece. It keeps everything efficient and saves you a ton of time.
2. Why is sliding window efficient for this problem? It cuts down complexity. Instead of recalculating the sum for each 7-day period from scratch, we just add the new value coming in and subtract the value that’s sliding out. That means we only need to do constant work per step, making it O(n) instead of recalculating the sum every time, which would be slower.
3. Can this technique be applied to other cases such as stock price analysis or temprature tracker? Yeah, 100%. Anytime you have a fixed-length window of data that you need to track or calculate something over, sliding window’s your friend. Whether it’s calculating moving averages in stock prices or tracking temperature changes over time, you’re just sliding over the data, updating the part you care about without starting from scratch every time.
